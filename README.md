<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Before running the application, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. The tkinter library is usually included with standard Python installations, so you likely won't need to install it separately.

<h3>How to Run</h3>
<h4>Clone the repository:</h4>
git clone https://github.com/RajivRanjan-1/Clock-in-Python.git
cd YourRepoName

<h4>Execute the script:</h4>
Run the Python script directly from your terminal.
python clock.py

<h3>Code Overview</h3>
The script uses Python's built-in time and tkinter modules. The tkinter module is used to create the main window and a label widget to display the time. A function is called periodically (every 1000 milliseconds) using label.after() to update the time displayed on the label, ensuring the clock is always accurate.
